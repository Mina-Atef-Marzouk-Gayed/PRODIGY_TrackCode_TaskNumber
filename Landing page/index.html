        <h1>Mountain</h1>
        <p>A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with 
            steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary,
            a mountain may differ from a plateau in having 
            a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at
            least 300 metres above the surrounding land.</p>
